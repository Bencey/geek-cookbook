# Discord

The best way to engage with our geeky community is in our [Discord server](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz)

!!! question "Eh? What's a Discord? Get off my lawn, young whippersnappers!!"

Yeah, I know. I also thought Discord was just for the gamer kids, but it turns out it's great for a geeky community. Why? [Let me elucidate ya.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qHoSWxVqtE)..

1. Native markdown for code blocks
2. Drag-drop screenshots
3. Costs nothing, no ads
4. Mobile notifications are reliable, individual channels mutable, etc

## How do I join the Discord server?

1. Create [an account](https://discordapp.com)
2. [Join the geek party](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz)!

`!help` Shows help content.

## Spread the love (inviting others)

If you want to send your friends a link to the Discord server there are two ways that you can do so. The most easiest way is you can send them http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz,  or you can right click on the Discord server and click "Invite People"

## Formatting your message

Discord supports markdown, markdown allows you to format your messages for example you can bold your message, you can underline it. If you want to learn how to use markdown you can read one of the guides that Discord made on [how to use markdown](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-)

## How do I suggest something?

The first thing you will need to do is find the #suggestions channel in the Discord. Next you will make sure that your suggestion has not been suggested before. You can see if your suggestion has been requested by either reading the channel or you can use the search feature in the top right of your screen. If it has not been suggested then you will type the following message `!suggest [Suggestion]` For example `!suggest A guide on how to use Discord`. When you send the message a new message will appear with your suggestion where users can upvote or downvote your suggestion.

If there is something that is not listed in this guide but you cannot figure out you can head over to Discords support center [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us) where they have resources to help you. (Or you can suggest to edit this guide)
