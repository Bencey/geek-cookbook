# Wallet

You may be mining a particular coin, and want to hold onto it, in the hopes of long-term growth. The safest place to stick that coin, therefore, is an a wallet.

## Preparation

### Get your wallets

Your favorite coin probably has a link to various desktop wallets on their website. All you have to do is download the wallet to your desktop, fire it up, and then **backup your public/private key somewhere safe**.

### Wallets I use

I mine most of my coins to Exchanges, but I do have the following wallets:

* [Jaxx](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/jaxx-blockchain-wallet/id1084514516?mt=8) on my iPhone for popular coins (BTC, ETH, etc)
* Eleos wallet for [ZClassic](https://zclassic.org/)
