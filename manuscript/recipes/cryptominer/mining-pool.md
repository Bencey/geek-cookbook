# Mining Pools

You and your puny GPUs don't have a snowball's chance of mining a block on your own. Your only option is to join a mass mining conglomerate (_a mining pool_), throw in your share of the effort for a share of the reward.

## Preparation

### Setup accounts at mining pools

This'll save you some frustration later... Next time you're watching a movie or doing something mindless, visit http://whattomine.com/, and take note of the 10-15 most profitable coins for your GPU type(s).

On your [exchanges](/recipes/cryptominer/exchange/), identify the "_deposit address_" for each popular coin, and note them down for the next step.

!!! note  
    If you're wanting to mine directly to a wallet for long-term holding, then substitute your wallet public address for this deposit address.

Now work your way through the following list of pools, creating an account on each one you want as you go. In the case of each pool/coin, setup your "payout address" to match your change address for the coin (above).

* [Mining Pool Hub](https://miningpoolhub.com/) (Lots of coins)
* [NiceHash](https://nicehash.com) (Ethereum, Decred)
* [suprnova](https://suprnova.cc/) - Lots of coins, but, you generally need a separate login for each pool. You _also_ need to create a worker in each pool with a common username and password, for [Minerhotel](/recipes/crytominer/minerhotel/).
* [nanopool](https://nanopool.org/) (Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, SiaCoin, ZCash, Monero, Pascal and Electroneum)
* [slushpool](https://slushpool.com/home/) (BTC and ZCash)

### Avoid fees

As noted by IronicBadger [here](https://www.linuxserver.io/2018/01/20/how-to-build-a-cryptocurrency-mining-rig/), the name of the game is avoiding fees where possible. Here are a few tips:

* [Mining Pool Hub](https://miningpoolhub.com/) is a popular pool for multiple coins, and it allows you (_for a fee_) to auto-exchange the coins you mine for coins that you actually _want_.
* [NiceHash](https://nicehash.com) will allow you to send your earned bitcoin (_whatever you mine, they pay you in bitcoin_) to coinbase for free.
