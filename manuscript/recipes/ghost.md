hero: Ghost - A recipe for beautiful online publication.

# Ghost

[Ghost](https://ghost.org) is "a fully open source, hackable platform for building and running a modern online publication."

![](/images/ghost.png)

## Ingredients

1. [Docker swarm cluster](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) with [persistent shared storage](/ha-docker-swarm/shared-storage-ceph.md)
2. [Traefik](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik) configured per design

## Preparation

### Setup data locations

Create the location for the bind-mount of the application data, so that it's persistent:

```
mkdir -p /var/data/ghost
```


### Setup Docker Swarm

Create a docker swarm config file in docker-compose syntax (v3), something like this:

!!! tip
        I share (_with my [patreon patrons](https://www.patreon.com/funkypenguin)_) a private "_premix_" git repository, which includes necessary docker-compose and env files for all published recipes. This means that patrons can launch any recipe with just a ```git pull``` and a ```docker stack deploy``` üëç

```
version: '3'

services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:1-alpine
    volumes:
     - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
     - /var/data/ghost/:/var/lib/ghost/content
    networks:
    - traefik_public
    deploy:
      labels:
        - traefik.frontend.rule=Host:ghost.example.com
        - traefik.docker.network=traefik
        - traefik.port=2368

networks:
  traefik_public:
    external: true
```


## Serving

### Launch Ghost stack

Launch the Ghost stack by running ```docker stack deploy ghost -c <path -to-docker-compose.yml>```

## Chef's Notes

1. If I wasn't committed to a [static-site-generated blog](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/blog/), Ghost is the platform I'd use for my blog.
2. A default using the SQlite database takes 548k of space:
```
[root@ds1 ghost]# du -sh /var/data/ghost/
548K	/var/data/ghost/
[root@ds1 ghost]#
```
