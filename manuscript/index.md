# What is this?

Funky Penguin's "**[Geek Cookbook](https://geek-cookbook.funkypenguin.co.nz)**" is a collection of how-to guides for establishing your own container-based self-hosting platform, using either [Docker Swarm](/ha-docker-swarm/design/) or [Kubernetes](/kubernetes/start/). 

Running such a platform enables you to run self-hosted tools such as [AutoPirate](/recipes/autopirate/) (*Radarr, Sonarr, NZBGet and friends*), [Plex](/recipes/plex/), [NextCloud](/recipes/nextcloud/), and includes elements such as:

* [Automatic SSL-secured access](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik/) to all services (*with LetsEncrypt*)
* [SSO / authentication layer](/ha-docker-swarm/traefik-forward-auth/) to protect unsecured / vulnerable services
* [Automated backup](/recipes/elkarbackup/) of configuration and data
* [Monitoring and metrics](/recipes/swarmprom/) collection, graphing and alerting

Recent updates and additions are posted on the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG/), and there's a friendly community of like-minded geeks in the [Discord server](http://chat.funkypenguin.co.nz).

## Who is this for?

You already have a familiarity with concepts such as [virtual](https://libvirt.org/) [machines](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, [LetsEncrypt SSL certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/), databases, and command-line interfaces.

You've probably played with self-hosting some mainstream apps yourself, like [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) or even [SandStorm](https://sandstorm.io/).

## Why should I read this?

So if you're familiar enough with the concepts above, and you've done self-hosting before, why would you read any further?

1. You want to upskill. You want to work with container orchestration, Prometheus and Grafana, Kubernetes
2. You want to play. You want a safe sandbox to test new tools, keeping the ones you want and tossing the ones you don't.
3. You want reliability. Once you go from __playing__ with a tool to actually __using__ it, you want it to be available when you need it. Having to "*quickly ssh into the basement server and restart plex*" doesn't cut it when you finally convince your wife to sit down with you to watch sci-fi.
