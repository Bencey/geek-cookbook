# Welcome to Funky Penguin's Geek Cookbook

## Hello world,

I'm [David](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/contact/).

I'm a contracting IT consultant, with a broad range of experience and skills. I'm an [AWS Certified Solution Architect (Professional)](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=4&t=c&d=2019-02-22&ci=AWS00794574), a remote worker, I've had a [book published](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/phplist-2-email-campaign-manager/), and I [blog](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/blog/) on topics that interest me.

## Why Funky Penguin?

My first "real" job, out of high-school, was working the IT helpdesk in a typical pre-2000 organization in South Africa. I enjoyed experimenting with Linux, and cut my teeth by replacing the organization's Exchange 5.5 mail platform with a 15-site [qmail-ldap](http://www.nrg4u.com/) cluster, with [amavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amavis) virus-scanning.

One of our suppliers asked me to quote to do the same for their organization. With nothing to loose, and half-expecting to be turned down, I quoted a generous fee, and chose a cheeky company name. The supplier immediately accepted my quote, and the name ("_Funky Penguin_") stuck.

## Technical Documentation

During the same "real" job above, I wanted to deploy [jabberd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabberd14), for internal instant messaging within the organization, and as a means to control the sprawl of ad-hoc instant-messaging among staff, using ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo Messenger.

To get management approval to deploy, I wrote a logger (with web UI) for jabber conversations ([Bandersnatch](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/project/bandersnatch/)), and a [75-page user manual](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/jajc-manual/) (_in [Docbook XML](http://www.docbook.org/)_) for a spunky Russian WinXP jabber client, [JAJC](http://jajc.jrudevels.org/).

Due to my contributions to [phpList](http://www.phplist.com), I was approached in 2011 by [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com), to [write a book](https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/book/phplist-2-email-campaign-manager) about using PHPList.
